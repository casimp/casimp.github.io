    I'm a senior research scientist who specialises in Data Science and Computer Vision for Materials Science, currently working to solve NDE data challenges for Industry 4.0. 
    I've developed widely used tools built on Python's scientific stack to efficiently process, analyse and visualise the high volume of complex data produced at synchrotron science facilities. 
    I've recently applied for, and won, research funding to study Offshore Wind Structures and I'm interested in businesses and technology that helps society move towards a low carbon future.
